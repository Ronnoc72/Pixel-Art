# Pixel-Art
This is a python program that allows you to draw pixel art. The visualization is with pygame.
You can only switch the colors with a keyboard input from 'q-y' and erase with 'a' and clear the whole screen with 'z'.
The screen stays the same size, but it can be modified to change to size in the future.
